# Summary
Based on the data, our analysis showed the bikes were most used by males, ages 25-34 with heavy use on weekdays during work commuting hours.  This would make one to believe the bikes are used as a mode of transportation to and from work for some people.  Without further analysis though, that is only an assumption.  
- The population of Des Moines, Iowa has about 31% in the age ranges of 20-39.  This fits well with the results from the NYC data.  
- Comparing NYC and Des Moines public transit options would be a further analysis to determine if a similar program would be a profitable venture in Des Moines.
- Analyzing age of subscribers could be a good option to find age ranges to target for specific marketing campaigns.
